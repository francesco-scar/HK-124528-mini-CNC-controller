# HK-124528 Mini-CNC controller - Arduino interface

I created this repository just to save somewhere some documentation about the HK-124528 CNC driver board, because at the time I'm writing this I wasn't able to find information about this specific board, so there is no code in this repo, but just text and images.

## Introduction

The HK-124528 is a board that takes as input from the parallel port connector the signals of steps and direction for each of the 3 stepper motors. At each pulse of the step data line the board send the current to the relative motor in order to make it step once in the direction specified by the direction data line (eg. 0V --> Clockwise; 5V --> Counterclockwise, but it depends by the motor's coils connections).
I used the [grbl](https://github.com/grbl/grbl) firmware (Version 1.1, but other versions should work as well) on an Arduino Uno board to control the driver.

## Parallel port connections

From here on I will number parallel port pins accordingly to the standard parallel port pin numeration (as shown in this Wikipedia image, By AndrewBuck - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0 [click here for more information](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=2565019))

I found out the following connections:

## Arduino Uno Connections

I connected the pins above to the Arduino Uno accordingly to their function; in the [grbl source](https://github.com/grbl/grbl/blob/master/grbl/cpu_map/cpu_map_atmega328p.h) code there are those definitions for pins:

```
// Define step pulse output pins. NOTE: All step bit pins must be on the same port.
#define STEP_DDR        DDRD
#define STEP_PORT       PORTD
#define X_STEP_BIT      2  // Uno Digital Pin 2
#define Y_STEP_BIT      3  // Uno Digital Pin 3
#define Z_STEP_BIT      4  // Uno Digital Pin 4
#define STEP_MASK       ((1<<X_STEP_BIT)|(1<<Y_STEP_BIT)|(1<<Z_STEP_BIT)) // All step bits

// Define step direction output pins. NOTE: All direction pins must be on the same port.
#define DIRECTION_DDR     DDRD
#define DIRECTION_PORT    PORTD
#define X_DIRECTION_BIT   5  // Uno Digital Pin 5
#define Y_DIRECTION_BIT   6  // Uno Digital Pin 6
#define Z_DIRECTION_BIT   7  // Uno Digital Pin 7
#define DIRECTION_MASK    ((1<<X_DIRECTION_BIT)|(1<<Y_DIRECTION_BIT)|(1<<Z_DIRECTION_BIT)) // All direction bits

// Define stepper driver enable/disable output pin.
#define STEPPERS_DISABLE_DDR    DDRB
#define STEPPERS_DISABLE_PORT   PORTB
#define STEPPERS_DISABLE_BIT    0  // Uno Digital Pin 8
```

You can change them if you want, but you have to pay attention (as said in the comments) that `All step/direction bit pins must be on the same port`.

I made this connections:

| Parallel Pin | Function | Arduino Pin |
|:------------:|:--------:|:-----------:|
|1|-|-|
|CN7 CLK+ (2)\*|X Step|2|
|3|X Dir|5|
|CN8 CLK+ (4)\*|Y Step|3|
|5|Y Dir|6|
|CN10 CLK+ (6)\*|Z Step|4|
|7|Z Dir|7|
|8|-|-|
|9|-|-|
|10|Emergency button \*\*|A0|
|11|-|-|
|12|-|-|
|13|-|-|
|14*|Power and enable stepper\*\*\*|GND|
|15|-|-|
|16|-|-|
|17|-|-|
|-|Z Probe|A5|
|GND|GND|GND|

\* I connected those right before the optocoupler, after the controlled buffer output, because, for some reason, if I connect both step and dir signal to the parallel port the motors loose steps, otherwise with both after the buffer the motors turn only in one direction or not work at all (but could be a problem of the board I tested and both on parallel port could work for you, just try it if you want).

\*\* **ATTENTION:** The emergency stop is handled in software, in my case, so test it consistently before regular use of the CNC, because the false safe-feeling of it can be really dangerous in an emergency situation. In addition to this, in my case, the spindle has a separate driver circuit and is manually controlled by a switch and a potentiometer, so the emergency button will **NOT** stop it and the spindle will continue to rotate, pay attention to that too.

\*\*\* you can connect this pin to pin 8, so that the steppers are enabled only when they have to turn, but I prefered keep them always active to avoid unwanted movements (and position loss), this way it consume more current and motors and drivers can heat up a little more, but otherwise the motors don't oppose resistance to unwanted forces along the axis.

## Flash firmware on Arduino Uno

To flash the GRBL firmware you can just download it from [their repository](https://github.com/grbl/grbl) and open the /grbl/examples/grblUpload/grblUpload.ino file in the Arduino IDE and upload it on the board (as any other Arduino sketch).

Note: I don't have any credits for the grbl firmware, I'm just a normal user, they and their community did all the work :-)

## Universal G-Code Sender (UGS)

The easyest way, in my opinion, to send send the g-code instructions to your grbl controlled CNC is using the universal g-code sender and you can find information about installation and usage on the [UGS github repository](https://github.com/winder/Universal-G-Code-Sender).

To test that everything works so far you can just connect your arduino to the PC using a USB cable, launch UGS and choose the right port from the drop-down menu. Select the right baud-rate (the default one is 115200) and click the connect icon. When the connection is established you can move the machine using the jog window.

Note: Again, I don't have any credits for the UGS software, I'm just a normal user, they and their community did all the work :-)


This is still a work in progress...
